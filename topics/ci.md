[//]: # (title: Integration with CI systems)

Qodana [linters](linters.md) are packed into ready-to-use [Docker images](docker-images.md). They can be integrated into virtually any Continuous Integration (CI) system in a similar manner.

Currently, the following CI integration mechanisms are available:

 - [](qodana-github-application.md)
 - [](gitlab.md)
