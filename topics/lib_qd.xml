Running analysis locally is a resource-intensive operation. If you experience issues, consider increasing the Docker Desktop runtime memory limit, which by default is set to 2 GB. See the Docker Desktop documentation for <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/#resources">Windows</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/#resources">Mac</a>.
