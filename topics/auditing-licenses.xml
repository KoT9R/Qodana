    <var name="feature" value="Qodana License Audit"/>

    <p>To be able to conform with licenses of your project dependencies, you will need to explore the licenses such dependencies
    are licenses under, and make sure that the license of your project completely conforms with them.</p>

    <!-- I need to explain how the linter works and searches for text licenses. I need to ask Viktor about it -->

    <p>The %feature% feature employs the <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/">SPDX License List</a> and provides the
        following features for inspecting compatibility of your project dependencies: </p>
    <list>
        <li>Inspect license compatibility between your project and project dependencies</li>
        <li>Ignore specified licenses</li>
        <li>Override specified licenses in the license matrix</li>
        <li>Create customer dependencies for including them into the %product% report</li>
    </list>

    <p>Currently, the %feature% feature supports the JPS, Maven, Gradle, npm, yarn and composer projects.</p>

    <p>This feature is included in all existing %product% <a href="linters.md">linters</a>, so no installation steps are
    required. All configuration is carried out using the
        <a href="qodana-yaml.md"><code style="inline">qodana.yaml</code></a> file. To enable the License audit feature,
        add these lines to <code style="inline">qodana.yaml</code>:</p>
    <code style="block" lang="yaml">
        include:
          - name: CheckDependencyLicenses
    </code>

    <!-- The universal command from the CLI utilitiy needs to be listed here -->
    <p>Run %product% using your linter. For example, it can be the universal </p>

    <p>Open the %product% report and click the <menupath>Project audit</menupath> tab to see more information about
        license audit results. </p>

    <!-- This needs to be reviewed before submitting -->
    <p>The <menupath>License rules</menupath> tab contains the table of license correspondence. The
        <menupath>Project license</menupath> column lists
        license names, while the <menupath>Allowed licenses</menupath> and the <menupath>Prohibited licenses</menupath>
        columns list the licenses that are compatible and incompatible with the license respectively. This can be
        helpful when you need to override licenses.</p>
