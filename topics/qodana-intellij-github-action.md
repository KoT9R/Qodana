While the [Qodana IntelliJ GitHub app](qodana-intellij-github-application.md) supports only public repositories, for private repositories use the Qodana IntelliJ GitHub action as described in this section.

The **Qodana IntelliJ GitHub action** is a more general tool for easier continuous code inspection.
Anyone with the write permission to a repository can set up a continuous code inspection with Qodana using GitHub actions.
